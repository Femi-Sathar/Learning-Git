<h1>Understanding Version Control,Why Git?<h1>
  <ul>
  <li> Let's say that you created a new code file and written a few lines in it - codefile1.</li>
  <li>Now you decide to put it under version control using Git.</li>
  <l1>let's say that you call this save point as number 1. - <strong>version1</strong></l1>
  <li>later on as you progress you write maybe a few more lines of code.<li>
  <li>And at this point you decide to make another save point and I call this <strong>second version.</strong><li>
  <li>So further down the line you accidentally screw up your entire code file and it's irreparable 
  <li>you simply just want to roll back to the last save point or need to find what changes you have made.</li>
  <li>you can do that using Git.</li>
  <li> So you can either compare your current code file so the current mess that you've made against a previous version so that any of the save points before.</li>
  <li>Alternatively you can simply just roll back to a previous version and it doesn't have to be the one that was immediately previous.</li>
  <li>You can go as far back or as far forwards as you like as long as you know which version you want.</li>
  </ul>
